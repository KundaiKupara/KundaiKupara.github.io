                <p class="description-text">Nestled behind Luna Park and tucked into the slopes of Lavender Bay, Wendy’s Secret Garden is a magical, ever-evolving sanctuary created by artist Wendy Whiteley, the widow of renowned Australian painter Brett Whiteley. What was once an overgrown, neglected railway embankment has been transformed into one of Sydney’s most beloved green spaces—a place of healing, creativity, and quiet reflection.</p></div>

            <h3>A Note</h3>
            <p>After Brett’s death in 1992, Wendy began clearing the land near their home, driven by grief and a desire to create beauty.<br>
                Over the decades, she cultivated a vibrant garden filled with native and exotic plants, winding paths, whimsical sculptures, and hidden nooks.<br>
                The garden is now open to the public seven days a week, free of charge, and maintained in partnership with the NSW Government and North Sydney Council.<br><br>
</p>

            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <p>- Meandering pathways through lush foliage and towering fig trees<br>
            - Sculptures and fairy houses tucked into corners and under leaves<br>
            - Harbour views that peek through the greenery<br>
            - Picnic spots and benches perfect for reading, sketching, or daydreaming<br>
            - A palpable sense of peace and creativity, infused with Wendy’s artistic spirit<br>
            Though it’s called a “secret,” the garden has become a cherished destination for locals and visitors alike. It’s accessible via Clark Park on Lavender Street, just a short walk from Milsons Point or North Sydney train stations.
