                <p class="description-text">Carved into the sandstone cliffs of Queenscliff Headland in 1908 by local fishermen, the Manly Wormhole—also known as the Queenscliff Tunnel—is a narrow, 40-metre passage that connects Queenscliff Beach to Freshwater Beach. Originally built to avoid the treacherous climb over rocks, the tunnel has become a local legend and a favourite among adventurous walkers and photographers.</p></div>

            <h3>What Makes it Special</h3>
            <p>- <strong><em>Historic Origins</em></strong>: Dug by hand over a century ago, the tunnel reflects the ingenuity of early coastal communities.<br>
            - <strong><em>Scenic Adventure</em></strong>: The walk to the wormhole involves scrambling over rocks along the headland, offering dramatic ocean views and a sense of discovery.<br>
            - <strong><em>Instagram-Worthy</em></strong>: The curved tunnel frames the sea beautifully, making it a popular spot for photos—especially at sunrise or sunset.<br>
            - <strong><em>No Signposts</em></strong>: True to its “secret” status, there are no official signs or paths leading to the wormhole. It’s known mostly by locals and intrepid explorers.<br><br>
</p>

            <h3>How to Find It</h3>
            <p>Start from Queenscliff Rockpool near the Queenscliff Surf Life Saving Club. From there, follow the rocky shoreline around the headland.<br>
            Look for a bright pink heart painted near the entrance—a subtle marker that you’re close. Be sure to attempt the walk during low tide, as waves can be unpredictable and the rocks slippery.
